# Question 1.
You are given an m x n matrix grid of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.
Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: true

Explanation:



A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Output: false

Explanation:

No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is false.

 

Constraints:

1 <= m == grid.length <= 105
1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
# Question 2.


You are given an m x n matrix grid of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
The sum of elements in both sections is equal, or can be made equal by discounting at most one single cell in total (from either section).
If a cell is discounted, the rest of the section must remain connected.
Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise, return false.

Note: A section is connected if every cell in it can be reached from any other cell by moving up, down, left, or right through other cells in the section.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: true

Explanation:



A horizontal cut after the first row gives sums 1 + 4 = 5 and 2 + 3 = 5, which are equal. Thus, the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]

Output: true

Explanation:



A vertical cut after the first column gives sums 1 + 3 = 4 and 2 + 4 = 6.
By discounting 2 from the right section (6 - 2 = 4), both sections have equal sums and remain connected. Thus, the answer is true.
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,2,4],[2,3,5]]

Output: false

Explanation:



A horizontal cut after the first row gives 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 and 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.
By discounting 3 from the bottom section (10 - 3 = 7), both sections have equal sums, but they do not remain connected as it splits the bottom section into two parts ([2] and [5]). Thus, the answer is false.
Example 4:

Input: grid = [[4,1,8],[3,2,6]]

Output: false

Explanation:

No valid cut exists, so the answer is false.

 

Constraints:

1 <= m == grid.length <= 105
1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

Hint
You are given an m x n integer matrix mat and an integer k. The matrix rows are 0-indexed.

The following proccess happens k times:

Even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are cyclically shifted to the left.


Odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...) are cyclically shifted to the right.


Return true if the final modified matrix after k steps is identical to the original matrix, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 4

Output: false

Explanation:

In each step left shift is applied to rows 0 and 2 (even indices), and right shift to row 1 (odd index).



Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,2,1,2],[5,5,5,5],[6,3,6,3]], k = 2

Output: true

Explanation:



Example 3:

Input: mat = [[2,2],[2,2]], k = 3

Output: true

Explanation:

As all the values are equal in the matrix, even after performing cyclic shifts the matrix will remain the same.

 

Constraints:

1 <= mat.length <= 25
1 <= mat[i].length <= 25
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 25
1 <= k <= 50

# 4 Question 4...
We define the lcp matrix of any 0-indexed string word of n lowercase English letters as an n x n grid such that:

lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].
Given an n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, "aabd" is lexicographically smaller than "aaca" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before 'c'.

 

Example 1:

Input: lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]
Output: "abab"
Explanation: lcp corresponds to any 4 letter string with two alternating letters. The lexicographically smallest of them is "abab".
Example 2:

Input: lcp = [[4,3,2,1],[3,3,2,1],[2,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: "aaaa"
Explanation: lcp corresponds to any 4 letter string with a single distinct letter. The lexicographically smallest of them is "aaaa". 
Example 3:

Input: lcp = [[4,3,2,1],[3,3,2,1],[2,2,2,1],[1,1,1,3]]
Output: ""
Explanation: lcp[3][3] cannot be equal to 3 since word[3,...,3] consists of only a single letter; Thus, no answer exists.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n == lcp.length == lcp[i].length <= 1000
0 <= lcp[i][j] <= n

# Question 4,5
You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

Choose any two indices i and j such that i < j and the difference j - i is even, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
Return true if you can make the strings s1 and s2 equal, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abcdba", s2 = "cabdab"
Output: true
Explanation: We can apply the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbadba".
- Choose the indices i = 2, j = 4. The resulting string is s1 = "cbbdaa".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 5. The resulting string is s1 = "cabdab" = s2.
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abe", s2 = "bea"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.
 

Constraints:

n == s1.length == s2.length
1 <= n <= 105
s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Robots Collision.
There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.

All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.

If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

Note: The positions may be unsorted.

 
 

Example 1:



Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].
Example 2:



Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].
Example 3:



Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
 

Constraints:

1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105
1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109
directions[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'
All values in positions are distinct
